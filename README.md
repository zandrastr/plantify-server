# Plantify 🌵
## Your AI-powered plant search engine & virtual plant library

I created this web application as my final project during my studies at Medieinstitutet.   
Powered by ChatGPT’s API, this is a user-friendly online tool for plant lovers, making it easy to discover and share plant information and care tips. Users who are not logged in can explore all about plants using the app as a search engine. On top of that, users logged in can build their virtual plant library by saving their favorite plants.
